// Authored for story 046, sub-task 13.3 — R4.3.
//
// 13.3's objective: `overlay validate --help` renders `--json` as the boolean it
// is.
//
// # The trap, stated once
//
// pflag reads the FIRST back-quoted substring of a flag's usage string as that
// flag's VALUE PLACEHOLDER — the word printed after the flag name in `--help`
// to tell the operator what argument to supply. UnquoteUsage (pflag@v1.0.10,
// flag.go:594) scans for a back-quote, takes everything up to the closing one
// as the placeholder, and strips both quotes out of the sentence; only when no
// back-quote is present does it fall back to the flag's type, where "bool"
// means "no placeholder at all". FlagUsagesWrapped (flag.go:725) then appends
// that placeholder to the line: `      --name` + " " + placeholder.
//
// So a back-quote inside a BOOL flag's usage makes `--help` advertise a value
// the flag does not take. Nothing in the source says so — the registration is
// an ordinary Bool call with an ordinary sentence — and the damage appears only
// in rendered output, which is why this file is a standing guard rather than a
// one-line fix. The fix without the guard is invisible the day it is undone.
//
// # RED ON ARRIVAL
//
// cmd/bentoo/overlay_validate.go:115 registers --json as a Bool whose usage
// ends "... and `jq '.kind'` says which command wrote it". Against a HEAD
// binary:
//
//	$ bentoo overlay validate --help
//	      --json jq '.kind'   Write the whole report to stdout as a single JSON document. …
//
// At the story's branch point (c8e347e, same line) the sentence carried no
// back-quote and the flag rendered as a bare `--json`. Story 046 introduced it.
// It is the only back-quoted usage string among the flag registrations in this
// package.
//
// S046-R8.3 asks for recorded evidence that a guard fails when its rule is
// broken. This guard was red before the code it guards was written — the
// strongest form of that evidence, since no mutation had to be staged to
// produce it. TestFlagUsageSweepReportsABoolAndSparesAString keeps the
// capability provable after the fix lands and the two tests above go green.
//
// # Why this is not a source sweep for back-quotes
//
// The obvious cheap guard — grep the package's registrations and ban a
// back-quote in any usage string — would be WRONG, and would be deleted by the
// first person it obstructed. A back-quoted placeholder is pflag's documented
// and intended mechanism: on a flag that genuinely takes a value, writing
//
//	cmd.Flags().String("distdir", "", "Read distfiles from `dir`")
//
// is how you make `--help` say `--distdir dir` instead of `--distdir string`.
// The defect is not the back-quote; it is a placeholder on a flag that accepts
// no value. So the rule below is stated over exactly that: a flag whose
// Value.Type() reports "bool" (or "boolfunc", which pflag treats identically)
// must resolve to an EMPTY placeholder. String, Int and Duration flags may
// carry all the back-quotes they like and this guard stays silent on them —
// which the self-test proves in both directions.
//
// Reading the registered flags rather than the source text also means the guard
// sweeps what the operator actually gets: every flag on every command reachable
// from newRootCmd(), however it was registered, including any added tomorrow in
// a file this test has never heard of.
