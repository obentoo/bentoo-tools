// Authored for story 046, sub-task 9.2 — R7.4.
//
// Written from the contract: sub-task 9.2's objective — "The producer-to-
// consumer contract is verified across all three payloads and all renderers" —
// and story.md's Success Metric that a new kind costs no renderer edit. 6.3
// checks that no renderer NAMES a payload; this checks the other direction,
// that every payload actually goes through every renderer. A contract nothing
// exercised is a contract nobody has tested.
//
// Red on arrival: none of the three payloads exists.
//
// # Evidence that it still fails once they do (R8.3)
//
// The line above is a COMPILE failure, and a compile failure is not the rule
// this file states — it says only that the fixtures below name types task 1 had
// not written yet. It also stops being checkable the moment the package builds:
// from then on the matrix passes, and a green test proves nothing about what it
// would catch. R8.3 asks for the evidence a green guard cannot supply, and the
// story artifacts holding it (.draft/red-evidence.yaml) are not committed —
// `git ls-files .epic/` returns nothing — so a pointer to that file is a
// pointer to nothing for anyone who cloned this. citation_test.go makes that
// argument in full. The evidence is written down here instead, and it breaks
// the RULE rather than the build: a payload that does not survive a renderer.
//
// Measured on 2026-08-29, against sub-task 10.6. One mutation, applied on its
// own, run, and reverted immediately with `git checkout --`, the restore
// verified by `git status --porcelain` reporting nothing and by a second run of
// this test going green.
//
// Mutation: SnapshotRun.Sections in snapshot_run.go was made to answer with one
// EMPTY section. The payload still describes itself as a block, so it clears
// the len(blocks) check below and reaches all five renderers; it just puts no
// title, no lead, no row and no note inside the block —

//
// Two renderers out of five, and the three that stayed silent are the argument
// for running all five. Markdown still wrote a "## " for the empty title, the
// export still carried the envelope wrapped around the empty payload and named
// its kind, and the fullscreen model still drew its border and its key hint:
// each of those three produces output of its OWN, so each would have answered
// "yes, the payload arrived" about a payload that had arrived as nothing. Only
// plain and inline print nothing but what the section holds, which is what
// makes them the two that can answer the question at all — and a matrix built
// on the export alone, the obvious economy, would have caught none of it.
//
// The other two payloads passed in the same run, which is the second half of
// what makes the failure usable: it names the payload that broke rather than
// condemning the renderers.
//
// It is authored beside contract_test.go rather than into it: 6.3's guard and
// this matrix fail for different reasons, and one file failing for two reasons
// is one file whose failure has to be read twice.
//
// # The fourth payload, and the count that was never asserted (sub-task 16.3)
//
// Everything above was written and measured over THREE payloads, and the file
// said "three" while the CLI shipped four. `overlay validate` has emitted
// report.KindOverlayValidate since sub-task 8.1; everyKind never gained a run
// for it, and nothing counted the list, so the renderer contract S046-R7.4 rests on
// was checked over three kinds of four for four audits — passing each time,
// exactly as convincingly as it would have with all four, because a guard that
// sweeps a hand-written list cannot tell a short list from a complete one.
//
// 16.3 adds the run (validateDeclaration, below) and adds the thing that makes
// the addition stick: a CENSUS at the top of TestEveryPayloadEveryRenderer,
// against payloadKindCount and against the Kind constants the report package
// declares. The list is no longer trusted.
//
// Measured on 2026-09-02, against HEAD 0fd2f2e. Five mutations, each applied
// ALONE, run, and reverted immediately — every revert verified by md5sum
// against the pre-mutation file and, for the two files outside this sub-task's
// diff, by `git status --porcelain` showing them unmodified.
//
// M1 — the fourth run deleted from everyKind, restoring the three-of-four state
// this sub-task found:
//
//	--- FAIL: TestEveryPayloadEveryRenderer (0.00s)
//	    contract_payload_matrix_test.go: everyKind built 3 runs, want 4 — one
//	    per payload this CLI ships.
//	            A payload missing here is a payload the renderer contract is not
//	            checked over, and the sweep goes green either way (S046-R7.4, S046-R8.3).
//
// M2 — validateDeclaration.Sections made to answer one EMPTY section, the same
// mutation 10.6 applied to SnapshotRun:
//
//	--- FAIL: TestEveryPayloadEveryRenderer/overlay.validate (0.00s)
//	    contract_payload_matrix_test.go: plain rendered overlay.validate as nothing
//	    contract_payload_matrix_test.go: inline rendered overlay.validate as nothing
//	    --- PASS: autoupdate.check, overlay.manifest, snapshot.run
//
// The same two renderers of five, for the same reason 10.6 gives, and the three
// PASSes are what make the failure name the payload rather than the renderers.
// This is the mutation that proves the fourth entry is LIVE: it reaches all
// five renderers, and two of them can report on it.
//
// M3 — the fourth run's Kind changed to a duplicate of snapshot.run, so the
// COUNT still came to four:
//
//	--- FAIL: TestEveryPayloadEveryRenderer (0.00s)
//	    contract_payload_matrix_test.go: everyKind builds 2 runs of kind
//	    "snapshot.run" — a duplicate hides a payload that is missing, because the
//	    count still comes to 4
//
// M3 is why the census compares the SET and not only the length. A run
// duplicated and a run missing keep the total at four between them, and that is
// arithmetic no len() can see.
//
// M4 — a fifth constant, `KindProbeRun Kind = "probe.run"`, added to
// internal/common/report/run.go and deliberately not given a run here:
//
//	--- FAIL: TestEveryPayloadEveryRenderer (0.00s)
//	    contract_payload_matrix_test.go: the report package declares 5 Kind
//	    constants ([autoupdate.check overlay.manifest snapshot.run
//	    overlay.validate probe.run]), and payloadKindCount says 4 — the number
//	    here is stale, not the code
//
// M4 is the one that answers "who counts the counter". It is the failure the
// three-of-four hole should have produced when 8.1 added the kind and did not,
// because until 16.3 nothing here read run.go at all.
//
// M5 — `"validate.Report"` removed from payloadTypes (contract_test.go), the
// subject list this file's second guard sweeps:
//
//	--- FAIL: TestNoRendererSwitchesOnAPayloadType (0.00s)
//	    contract_payload_matrix_test.go: payloadTypes holds 4 entries
//	    ([report.Report report.AutoupdateCheck report.ManifestRun
//	    report.SnapshotRun]), want 5 — one per payload this CLI ships, plus
//	    report.Report for the pre-D1 name of the first.
//	--- PASS: TestEveryPayloadEveryRenderer (all four kinds)
//
// That PASS is the argument for censusing BOTH lists rather than one. The
// matrix and the subject list guard different halves of S046-R7.4 — that every
// payload survives every renderer, and that no renderer knows a payload — so a
// short subject list is invisible to a complete matrix, and was.
//
// Every transcript above is recorded WITHOUT this file's own line numbers, and
// that is deliberate rather than sloppy. A number a failing run prints is a
// coordinate in the file as it was WHEN IT RAN, and this header is inside the
// file the numbers point into: writing one down changes the length of the thing
// it is a coordinate for, and re-running to refresh it changes it again. The
// number was wrong before the paragraph recording it was finished, twice,
// which is how this note came to exist.
//
// It is not a hypothetical failure either. The 10.6 transcript higher up this
// header still says `contract_payload_matrix_test.go:182`, and line 182 has not
// been that assertion since the day it was written. That record is left exactly
// as 10.6 wrote it — it is that sub-task's evidence, not this one's to edit —
// and it is cited here as the measurement that decided this form.
//
// text.go's numbers ARE kept, because they are coordinates in a different file
// and they name the probe the mutation inserted, which exists only in the
// mutated file by definition. The register at
// .draft/red-evidence.yaml keeps every number verbatim, for the opposite
// reason: it is a separate file, so its copy does not move what it describes.

// payloadKindCount is how many payloads this CLI ships, and therefore how many
// runs everyKind must build: FIVE — autoupdate.check, overlay.manifest,
// snapshot.run, overlay.validate and overlay.compare.
//
// The number is written down because it is the one this file got wrong.
// everyKind held THREE of the four from sub-task 8.1 — the change that started
// emitting `overlay.validate` — until 16.3, and nothing anywhere counted it: the
// literal below was read as "one run per payload" and believed. A guard that
// sweeps a hand-written list passes exactly as convincingly when the list is
// short, which is how three-of-four survived four audits.
//
// So the list is counted twice over, against two things that can disagree with
// it: against this constant, and against the report.Kind constants run.go
// actually declares (declaredKinds, below). The constant alone would be merely
// self-consistent; the derivation alone would not say what the number IS, and a
// reviewer would have nothing to check the diff against.
//
// Story 047 adds the fifth kind. It did, in sub-task 2.4, and the paragraph
// above is the record that it cost exactly what was predicted: this constant,
// everyKind and payloadTypes changed together in one reviewable diff, which is
// the point of stating the number rather than trusting the literal. A partial
// edit fails the census loudly — that is the design, not an obstacle, and it is
// why the three were not staged separately.
//
// The fifth kind is `overlay.compare`, and NOT the model for `overlay.validate`
// that validateDeclaration below predicts a few lines further on. That
// prediction was written during story 046 when "047" meant "the next story";
// internal/common/report/run.go carries the correction in full, on
// KindOverlayValidate. The stand-in stays, because the payload it stands in for
// is still in `package main`.
//
// # Why everyKind and payloadTypes stay two lists, censused against one number
//
// They are two hand-maintained lists of the same four payloads, so the obvious
// tidy is to derive one from the other. It cannot be done, and the reason is
// what each list is FOR.
//
// everyKind holds RUNS — a kind, an envelope, and a fully populated payload
// VALUE, because a fixture carrying counts and no rows renders a sentence and
// no table, and a matrix over it would check that five renderers agree about
// prose while never reaching what they differ on (sub-task 5.5's finding, cited
// in everyKind itself). Those values cannot be generated from a type name:
// nothing knows a ManifestRun fixture needs four targets with one failure, and
// a generated zero value is exactly the vacuous fixture 5.5 ruled out.
//
// payloadTypes holds SELECTORS a renderer must not spell — text, matched
// against source — and two of its six entries have no run here at all, by
// design. report.Report is a name no type carries any more, kept so the pre-D1
// spelling cannot come back; validate.Report is a producer type that is not a
// payload, only the half of one a renderer could reach. A derivation would have
// to invent both, and inventing entries is what makes a guard hollow.
//
// So they stay separate, and are tied at the one place they can honestly meet:
// the COUNT. everyKind is censused against this constant directly, payloadTypes
// against this constant plus one for report.Report, and the constant itself
// against the kinds the report package declares. That is what "four names,
// three kinds, and they are not the same four" cost — closed without pretending
// either list can be computed from the other.
//
// The duplication that WAS removable has been removed:
// TestNoRendererSwitchesOnAPayloadType kept a second literal of payloadTypes
// and now derives its set from it through forbiddenPayloadSelectors. That is
// the drift that actually happened, rather than the one that merely looks
// untidy.
const payloadKindCount = 5

// validateDeclaration stands in for cmd/bentoo's `validatePayload`, the fourth
// payload — and it is a STAND-IN because the real one cannot be reached from
// here.
//
// # What it stands for, and why the substitution is forced
//
// `validatePayload` embeds validate.Report, and internal/common/report may not
// import internal/autoupdate (boundary_test.go's forbiddenImports), so the type
// that puts a validation run in the payload position sits at the adapter, in
// `package main` under cmd/bentoo. No Go file can import main. The route the
// other three entries take — build a literal of the payload type — is therefore
// closed for this one, and no amount of rearranging opens it while the payload
// lives where the boundary requires.
//
// It follows the precedent the other three already set at a smaller scale
// rather than inventing one: none of them calls its producer either, because
// TestRenderImportsNoProducer forbids importing one, so each is a literal
// standing in for what a producer builds. This is that same substitution one
// step further out — the payload type as well as the producer.
//
// # The SHAPE it contributes, which is why it earns an entry
//
// One block, a title, a lead, notes, and NO TABLE. The other three payloads all
// carry rows, so until this entry the matrix never asked what five renderers do
// with a section that is prose alone. That is not a hypothetical shape: it is
// what validatePayload returns, and the version of it that returned NOTHING
// left `overlay validate --export=report.md` writing a file of zero bytes until
// sub-task 10.1 — a failure two of these five renderers are the only ones able
// to report, exactly as the SnapshotRun mutation above found.
//
// # What it therefore does NOT prove
//
// It does not prove that validatePayload's own Sections produces this shape,
// and it cannot: what is asserted below is a fact about the RENDERERS, over a
// payload of this shape. The derivation is pinned where the type is —
// cmd/bentoo/overlay_validate_payload_test.go asserts what Sections returns
// over four validation runs, and overlay_validate_export_test.go drives it
// through a real `overlay validate --export`. If validatePayload stopped
// matching the shape here, THOSE two fail and this one does not.
//
// The prose is deliberately written as placeholder text rather than copied from
// the real block: a near-copy would be a second declaration of sentences that
// live in cmd/bentoo, wrong the first time somebody rewords one, and silent on
// both sides when it happened. Nothing below asserts the words — only that five
// renderers produce something recognisable from a block that has them.
//
// Story 047 ends the substitution by moving this payload into the report
// package with a model of its own, at which point this type is deleted and a
// report.ValidateRun literal takes its place beside the other three.

// # It is a FUNCTION where the other four entries are literals

// The groups have to come from report.GroupKeep rather than from a hand-written

// list beside it, so a fixture that typed one by hand could disagree with the
// rule and every renderer would faithfully draw the disagreement. Building it
// through the exported rule is also what the adapter does — the one line
// GroupKeep's own doc writes out — so this fixture exercises the seam rather
// than imitating its output.
//
// # Why it carries ROWS, which is sub-task 5.5's finding restated
//
// A fixture carrying counts and no rows renders prose and no table, and a
// matrix over it would check that five renderers agree about a sentence while
// never reaching the thing they differ on. Every list below is therefore
// non-empty, and the keep list is shaped so all three arms of the grouping rule
// are live: a version pair with two members that becomes a group, a package
// whose finding keeps it out of that group even though its pair matches
// (S047-R2.2), and a pair with a single member that stays an ordinary row
// rather than becoming a group of one (S047-R2.5).
//
// The counts are consistent with the lists without being derived from them —
// nine scanned, eight carried by both trees and one only here, which is exactly
// the eight rows below plus the package that has nothing to compare against.
// The payload derives no count from any list and neither does this fixture; the
// agreement is what makes the rendered summary readable rather than a set of
// numbers that contradict the tables above them.
//
// # The vocabularies are the payload's own, not invented here
//
// Reading is one of the four words ComparePkg.Reading documents and Diff one of
// the four ComparePkg.Diff documents. A fixture spelling either differently
// would still render — every cell is printed exactly as it is carried — and
// would silently stop standing in for what the adapter produces.
//
// What this does NOT prove is the same thing validateDeclaration disclaims: it
// is a fact about the RENDERERS over a payload of this shape, not a claim that
// cmd/bentoo builds one. The adapter's own tests are where that is pinned.
