// Authored for story 046, sub-task 2.1 — R2.1, R2.2, R2.3, R6.1, R6.3.
//
// Written from the contract: design.md's Components block fixes the signature —
// "Plain(w, []Section, Options)", "Markdown", "Widths measured via
// lipgloss.Width" — and D2 fixes what a Section carries.
//
// Red on arrival: Plain and Markdown take report.Report today, so they cannot
// be called with sections at all.
//
// # It is authored beside text_test.go, not over it
//
// text_test.go holds story 044's golden suite for the check path, which
// Unchanged Behavior 1 forbids this story from moving. This file adds the
// section-level assertions; nothing here regenerates a golden.
