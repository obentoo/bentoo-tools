// Authored for story 046, sub-task 3.1 — R7.4, R4.2.
//
// Written from the contract: design.md D1 — "report.Report becomes
// report.AutoupdateCheck and implements Payload. Its fields, JSON tags and
// Reconciles() are unchanged — the rename is a move into the payload position,
// not a redesign of facts that story 044 got right." Unchanged Behavior 6 of
// story.md fixes the four column names and their meanings, and sub-task 3.1's
// own validation pins the Tally's tags byte-identical to HEAD.
//
// The names assumed beyond D1: AutoupdateCheck.Sections (Payload's one method,
// declared in D1) and Run.Sections — the envelope's own, because the
// "Run Interrupted" block is built from Complete and NotEvaluated, and D1 puts
// both in the ENVELOPE and neither in the payload. Something above the payload
// therefore has to state the gap, and this is the test that says so.
//
// Red on arrival: AutoupdateCheck does not exist — the type is still Report,
// and it has no Sections method.
