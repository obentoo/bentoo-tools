// Authored for story 047, sub-task 2.2 — S047-R1.1, S047-R3.2, S047-R3.3,
// S047-R6.1, S047-R6.2.
//
// What CompareRun.Sections SAYS, pinned. compare_run_json_test.go pins the
// other half — the document the same payload marshals into — and the two do
// not overlap: a key set is not something Sections can state, and a sentence is
// not something a JSON key can carry.
//
// # The cases here are the ones a rewrite could quietly lose
//
// Five of the six assertions below are about a report telling the truth rather
// than about it looking right, and each names the way it could go wrong:
//
//   - a section that vanishes when it has no row, which makes "nothing is
//     redundant" indistinguishable from a report that was cut short;
//   - a refusal to compare that is never named, which leaves an operator unable
//     to tell "we compared them and they match" from "we never compared them"
//     (S047-R3.3), and — the same defect one step on — a removal recommendation
//     that covers a package nobody read, which is the screen this story exists
//     to remove;
//   - a newline in a Row.Detail, which corrupts the plain writer's layout and
//     the Markdown pipe table alike (S047-R6.2);
//   - a long explanation put in a detail, where a renderer cuts it, rather than
//     in prose that wraps (S047-R6.1);
//   - a count that moves when --all changes the listing, which makes the number
//     under a table disagree with the table above it (S047-D7).
//
// The sixth is the block list itself, in order, which is the contract every
// renderer consumes.
